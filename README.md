+ In this project, I build a webpage for a gaming community and base it on real-life organization I belong to or make one up!. I get to choose everything about my page: the club name, the page layout and styling, any images that I want to use, and more!.

+ The whole project is based on css flexbox framework and properties and relative measurements.
